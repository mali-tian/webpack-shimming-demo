# Demo of webpack polyfills

Some old version browsers not very good at supporting HTML5 implementation, need polyfills to resolve this problem.
Use the `whatwg-fetch` polyfill as example.

#### Build by webpack
1. run `npm run build`
2. Open index.html through browser
Check the output from browser console.
